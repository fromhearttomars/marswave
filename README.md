# MarsWave (MVAWE) 🚀

Welcome to **MarsWave (MVAWE)**, the meme coin revolution that’s ready to launch to Mars — whether you’re ready or not. 🚀

**MarsWave (MVAWE)** is based on one accidental gesture by Elon Musk during president's inauguration. You know the one — the "zig" gesture. We decided to take that gesture, give it a little twist, and turn it into a meme coin. Because who needs actual space missions when you can meme your way to the stars, right?

### Features:

- 🚀 **Meme Coin:** Forget traditional currencies. MarsWave (MVAWE) is the future.
- ✋ **Elon Musk's Gesture:** We’re not mocking Musk, we're celebrating him.
- ❤️ **Heart-Shaped Rocket:** Because why not make everything we do a little more cute?
- 🔥 **Launch Coming Soon:** Buckle up. It’s about to get wild.

## How it Works

1. **A Gesture:** Inspired by Elon’s infamous "zig" gesture, which we’ve lovingly dubbed “From the Heart to Mars.”
2. **A Coin:** Because what better way to show your love for memes and crypto than with your very own MarsWave (MVAWE) token?
3. **A Journey:** Watch as the rocket takes a heart-shaped trajectory to the stars. Or at least until we get bored. 🚀
