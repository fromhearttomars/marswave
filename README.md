# MarsWave (MWAVE) 🚀

🚀 Welcome to MarsWave! 🌍💫

Not everything that looks like a Roman Salute is bad, right? 😉
Let’s focus on the future of humanity, not on what’s in the past. Imagine looking up at the stars — a symbol of progress, knowledge, and love. Let’s celebrate science, space exploration, and good vibes. 🌌

MarsWave is our way of doing just that. We’re taking a simple, misunderstood gesture, and turning it into a meme coin that points us toward a better, brighter future. 🚀💖

Forget the negativity — we’re here to meme our way to Mars with a heart full of hope, humor, and excitement. 💥

### Features:

- 🚀 **Meme Coin:** MarsWave (MWAVE) is just for fun and positivity.
- ✋ **Elon Musk's Gesture:** We’re not mocking Musk, we're celebrating him.
- ❤️ **Heart-Shaped Rocket:** Because why not make everything we do a little more cute?
- 🔥 **Launch Coming Soon:** Buckle up. It’s about to get wild.

## How it Works

1. **A Gesture:** Inspired by Elon’s infamous salute, which we’ve lovingly dubbed “From Heart to Mars.”
2. **A Coin:** Because what better way to show your love for memes and crypto than with your very own MarsWave (MWAVE) token?
3. **A Journey:** Watch as the rocket takes a heart-shaped trajectory to the stars. Or at least until we get bored. 🚀
